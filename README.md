  <strong>ProxMenux</strong> is a management tool for <strong>Proxmox VE</strong> that simplifies system administration through an interactive menu, allowing you to execute commands and scripts with ease.
</p>

---

## 📌 Installation

To install ProxMenux, simply run the following command in your Proxmox server terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/main/install_proxmenux.sh)"
```

> ⚠️ Be careful when copying scripts from the internet. Always remember to check the source!
>
> 📄 You can [review the source code](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/blob/main/install_proxmenux.sh) before execution.
>
> 🛡️ All executable links follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux?tab=coc-ov-file#-2-security--code-responsibility).

## 📌 How to Use

Once installed, launch **ProxMenux** by running:

```bash
menu
```

Then, follow the on-screen options to manage your Proxmox server efficiently.

## 🖥️ ProxMenux Monitor

ProxMenux Monitor is an integrated web dashboard that provides real-time visibility into your Proxmox infrastructure — accessible from any browser on your network, without needing a terminal.

**What it offers:**

- Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, disk usage and network traffic
- Overview of running VMs and LXC containers with status indicators
- Login authentication to protect access
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with TOTP support
- Reverse proxy support (Nginx / Traefik)
- Designed to work across desktop and mobile devices

**Access:**

Once installed, the dashboard is available at:

```
http://<your-proxmox-ip>:8008
```

The Monitor is installed automatically as part of the standard ProxMenux installation and runs as a systemd service (`proxmenux-monitor.service`) that starts automatically on boot.

**Useful commands:**

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status proxmenux-monitor

# View logs
journalctl -u proxmenux-monitor -n 50

# Restart the service
systemctl restart proxmenux-monitor
```

**Cluster federation (multi-node):**

Install ProxMenux on each node of your Proxmox cluster. On one node (the
"central" node), go to **Settings → Cluster Federation** and add the other
nodes by hostname + an API token (generated on each peer with `full_admin`
scope). A new **Cluster** entry (under the *Node* menu) then shows every node
in one view, and the node selector above the tabs lets you drill into any
node's full dashboard. Each node still collects its own metrics locally; the
central node aggregates them over the existing authenticated API (TLS verified
against the Proxmox cluster CA). The web terminal stays available only on the
node you are connected to. With no peers configured the dashboard is unchanged.

## 🧪 Beta Program

Want to try the latest features before the official release and help shape the final version?

The **ProxMenux Beta Program** gives early access to new functionality — including the newest builds of ProxMenux Monitor — directly from the `develop` branch. Beta builds may contain bugs or incomplete features. Your feedback is what helps fix them before the stable release.

**Install the beta version:**

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/develop/install_proxmenux_beta.sh)"
```

**What to expect:**

- You'll get new features and Monitor builds before anyone else
- Some things may not work perfectly — that's expected and normal
- When a stable release is published, ProxMenux will notify you on the next `menu` launch and offer to switch automatically

**How to report issues:**

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/issues) and include:
- What you did and what you expected to happen
- Any error messages shown on screen
- Logs from the Monitor if relevant:

```bash
journalctl -u proxmenux-monitor -n 50
```

> 💙 Thank you for being part of the beta program. Your help makes ProxMenux better for everyone.

## 🔧 Dependencies

The following dependencies are installed automatically during setup:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dialog` | Interactive terminal menus |
| `curl` | Downloads and connectivity checks |
| `jq` | JSON processing |
| `git` | Repository cloning and updates |
| `python3` + `python3-venv` | Translation support *(Translation version only)* |
| `googletrans` | Google Translate library *(Translation version only)* |

> **🛡️ Security Note / VirusTotal False Positive**
>
> If you scan the raw installation URL on VirusTotal, you might see a 1/95 detection by heuristic engines like *Chong Lua Dao*. This is a **known false positive**. Because this script uses the standard `curl | bash` installation pattern and downloads legitimate binaries (like `jq` from its official GitHub release), overly aggressive scanners flag the *behavior*. The script is 100% open source and safe to review. You can read more about this in [Issue #162](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/issues/162).
