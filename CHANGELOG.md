### Cluster federation — one dashboard for every node of a Proxmox cluster

The Monitor can now aggregate every node of a single Proxmox cluster into one dashboard. Install ProxMenux on each node as usual; on a chosen "central" node, add the other nodes under **Settings → Cluster Federation** (host + an API token generated on each peer with `full_admin` scope). The central node then exposes new `/api/federation/{peers,nodes,overview,vms}` endpoints plus a reverse proxy at `/api/proxy/<node>/<path>`: a **Cluster** view shows per-node CPU/RAM/temperature/health/VM-count cards, and a node selector lets you drill into any node's full existing dashboard (storage, network, hardware, VMs, remote start/stop). Each node keeps collecting its own local metrics; the central node merges them over the existing authenticated API, with TLS verified against the Proxmox cluster CA (`/etc/pve/pve-root-ca.pem`). The web terminal remains local-node only in this version. Fully backward compatible — with no peers configured the dashboard behaves exactly as before.

### New version ProxMenux v1.2.2 — *Stable consolidation of the v1.2.1.x cycle*

Stable release that brings the four prereleases of the **v1.2.1.x** cycle to the main channel in one move. The work over those four betas centred on three themes: making the Health Monitor genuinely configurable instead of just observable (per-category thresholds, per-event dismiss durations, an audit log of active suppressions), expanding the notification stack to cover roughly 80 services through Apprise while persisting events across Quiet Hours, and turning the Monitor process itself into a quieter, more predictable system citizen on idle hosts. On top of those, this release lands automatic upgrade detection for LXC containers, an end-to-end rewrite of the Coral TPU installer with the latest upstream drivers, and a long list of operator-visible fixes — HTTPS terminal handshake, kernel-update detection on PVE 9.x, NVIDIA installer flow on Alpine LXC, mixed-GPU passthrough audio companion handling, and several runtime optimizations on the Monitor scanning loops. Five direct code contributions from the community ship alongside ([@jcastro](https://github.com/jcastro) ×5, [@pespinel](https://github.com/pespinel) ×1) and the GPU passthrough work was driven by [@ghosthvj](https://github.com/ghosthvj)'s detailed field reports — see the Acknowledgments at the end.

## 🩺 Health Monitor — Configurable, Granular, Auditable

Three coupled pieces that together let the operator tune the Health Monitor to the actual envelope of their host instead of working around its defaults, and to manage dismisses with the same fine-grained control they already have over the rest of the dashboard.

### Per-category Warning / Critical thresholds

Every check the Health Monitor runs is parameterised by a pair of numbers — a *Warning* and a *Critical* — and both are now exposed under **Settings → Health Monitor Thresholds**. The defaults that ship with ProxMenux are reasonable for the average Proxmox host, but every environment has its own envelope:

- A small homelab with a single-disk SSD wants to page earlier on capacity (75 / 90 %) to leave room for snapshots.
- A datacentre node with redundant Ceph storage can be far more relaxed on memory warnings (90 % working set is normal under ZFS ARC).
- A passively-cooled mini-PC needs lower temperature thresholds than a server with forced-air cooling — same drive class, different physical envelope.

Edits take effect on the next scan — the Health Monitor re-reads the values from `/usr/local/share/proxmenux/health_thresholds.json` on every cycle, no service restart. The same numbers also feed the colour ranges of every dashboard widget (storage bars, CPU/memory rings, temperature chips, the dot on the disk modal), so the visual classification anywhere in the Monitor maps to a definite range relative to the configured pair.

### Per-event dismiss duration with a Permanent badge

The *Dismiss* button on each Health Monitor alert now opens a small dropdown with three options:

- **24 hours** — previous default, behaves exactly as before
- **7 days** — handy for a temporary condition you don't want to hear about during a week-long migration
- **Permanently** — silences this specific `error_key` indefinitely

Permanent dismisses persist with `suppression_hours = -1` in the persistence DB, never re-emit, never re-notify and are marked with a distinct amber **Permanent** badge in the Health Monitor so the operator always knows which alerts are intentionally silenced. The backend infrastructure for the permanent sentinel already existed — the UI just lacked a way to set it. The API contract is small and backwards-compatible: `POST /api/health/acknowledge` accepts an optional `suppression_hours` body field (positive integer for hours, `-1` for permanent); omitting it preserves the previous behaviour and uses the category's configured suppression. A second new endpoint `POST /api/health/un-acknowledge {error_key}` clears a previously-recorded acknowledgment so the alert becomes eligible to fire again — used by the Active Suppressions panel below.

### Active Suppressions panel in Settings

A new section inside **Settings → Health Monitor**, right below the per-category suppression durations, lists every currently-silenced alert — both time-limited dismisses (with a *22h remaining* / *6d remaining* badge) and permanent ones (with the amber *Permanent* badge from the dashboard). Each row carries the `error_key`, category, severity, the timestamp the dismiss was recorded, and a **Re-enable** button that clears the acknowledgment server-side. Re-enables are **queued** — clicking the button marks the row green with a strike-through and changes the button to *Undo*, and the actual `POST /api/health/un-acknowledge` only fires when the user clicks **Save**, so a batch of re-enables ships atomically alongside any pending per-category dropdown changes. The action is gated by the Health Monitor *Edit* toggle at the top of the card. Permanent dismisses **can only be reverted from here** — the dashboard intentionally does not expose a per-alert un-dismiss affordance to avoid accidental re-enables, so the Settings panel is the deliberate audit + revert surface for them. The list also refreshes automatically when an alert is dismissed from the Health Monitor modal while the Settings page is already open, via a `health-suppression-changed` browser event plus listeners on `window focus` and `document visibilitychange`.

### Disk I/O severity tiers

A sliding 24 h window now classifies dmesg ATA / SCSI errors into three buckets: silent (0–10 transient events), WARNING (11–100) and CRITICAL (100+, or any hard error like UNC / Buffer I/O / Sense Key Hardware Error). Quiet days stay quiet, but a single Buffer I/O event still pages immediately.

---

## 📨 Apprise Notification Channel — Full Feature Parity

The Apprise integration that landed as a basic adapter in 1.2.1.4-beta has graduated to full parity with the native channels. One Apprise URL now reaches roughly 80 notification services (Pushover, ntfy, Slack, Matrix, mailto, signal, Pushbullet, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams via webhooks, …) without ProxMenux needing a dedicated adapter for each. The Apprise tab in Notifications exposes the same controls as Telegram, Gotify, Discord and Email:

- The full **Notification Categories** block — the same 10 categories with their per-event sub-toggles, identical to the other channels
- **Quiet Hours** — start/end window per channel, with the same buffering behaviour (events fired during the window are persisted to SQLite and released as a grouped summary when the window closes, rather than being silently dropped)
- **Daily Digest** — opt-in once-a-day summary delivery at a chosen time

The backend's per-channel filtering already applied generically to every channel including Apprise via the `channel_overrides` block — the UI just wasn't surfacing it.

Three reliability fixes ship alongside, all surfaced after the initial beta rollout:

1. **Mobile overflow** on narrow viewports. The Apprise URL row used to break the design — the placeholder packed four full example URLs into one line and the inline `<code>` examples had no `break-all` rule. The placeholder is now a single concise example (`tgram://bottoken/ChatID`), the URL input wrapper enforces `min-w-0 / flex-1 / shrink-0` on its children, and the examples paragraph uses `break-all min-w-0` so it wraps cleanly at any width.

2. **Backend whitelist regression** that rejected Apprise with HTTP 400. The notifications-test validator's hard-coded channel set (`{telegram, gotify, discord, email, all}`) was missing `apprise`, so every Apprise test or send returned `400 Invalid channel` before the library was even invoked. The whitelist is now derived live from `notification_channels.CHANNEL_TYPES`, so adding a new channel implementation in the future cannot silently regress this validator again.

3. **Opaque error reporting** when the destination returned a non-2xx response. When a destination (`jsons://`, `ntfy://`, `slack://`, …) rejected the payload, the operator only saw a generic *"Apprise rejected the notification (transport failure)"* message. The channel now captures Apprise's internal logger during `notify()` and surfaces the real HTTP status code plus the destination's response body (capped at 300 chars) — so a beta tester debugging a custom webhook can immediately see whether the upstream server is rejecting their payload schema.

---

## 📦 LXC Update Detection

A new dedicated section in **Settings** (between *Health Monitor Thresholds* and *Notifications*) with a single toggle that gates the per-CT `apt list --upgradable` / `apk list -u` scan end-to-end. Default ON. When OFF the scan stops entirely (no `pct exec` calls), every `type=lxc` entry is purged from the managed-installs registry immediately, and the matching notification toggle in *Notifications → Services* disappears from the UI while preserving its stored preference.

The checker also reads the `mtime` of each CT's package-manager metadata cache and triggers `apt-get update` / `apk update` from outside via `pct exec` if it's older than 24 h, with a 60 s timeout and silent failure. Long-running appliance CTs whose caches were months stale finally surface their real upstream backlog — a Debian 12 CT with a 524-day-old cache went from "0 updates" to "117 (12 security)" on lab hardware.

---

## 🐧 Coral TPU on LXC — Latest Upstream Drivers

The Coral installer for LXC (`scripts/gpu_tpu/install_coral_lxc.sh`) was rewritten end-to-end to install the **latest upstream `gasket-dkms` driver** and the **latest `libedgetpu1` runtime** (220 lines added, 150 removed). Coral M.2 / mPCIe modules that previously failed to build on PVE 9 kernels now install and bind cleanly. The registry-driven update notifications that landed in 1.2.1.2 keep both packages fresh going forward: the Hardware tab + Notifications signal when feranick/gasket-driver publishes a newer release, and the `apt`-tracked `libedgetpu1` runtime gets the standard System Updates flow.

The companion **Coral installer uninstall path** also lands in this cycle — mirroring the NVIDIA flow so a Coral install can be cleanly reversed if the user re-deploys the host without TPU acceleration.

---

## ⚡ Monitor Performance Optimizations

A 10-minute strace + sampling run on a live host surfaced three places where the Monitor's background scanner was spawning subprocesses more aggressively than it needed to. All three are fixed in 1.2.2:

### fail2ban subprocess storm
On hosts where `fail2ban-client` was not installed, the cache wrapper around `_f2b_get_banned_ips()` only updated its timestamp on success. Every HTTP request to the dashboard fell through the cache check and fired a fresh `execve("fail2ban-client", ...)` that immediately failed with `ENOENT` — 250+ failed `execve` calls in a 10-minute window. `shutil.which('fail2ban-client')` is now resolved **once** at module load and the cache timestamp is updated unconditionally. Hosts without Fail2Ban now have zero `fail2ban-client` syscalls per request.

### smartctl scheduler collision
Disk SMART temperature polling, CPU temperature read and latency probe used to fire at the same offset within each minute, producing a measurable CPU / IO spike when all their subprocesses spawned together. The polls are now staggered (latency first, then CPU temperature, then disk SMART) while preserving the per-disk 60 s cadence — the spike is gone, total CPU under load is unchanged.

### LXC inventory subprocess
The mount monitor used to call `lxc-info -n <vmid> -p` for every running CT just to get its init PID. It now reads `/proc/<lxc-start-pid>/task/<lxc-start-pid>/children` directly and falls back to `lxc-info` only when the `/proc` read fails. One subprocess per CT per scan cycle eliminated — measurable on hosts with 20+ containers.

---

## 🔌 HTTPS Terminal Handshake

Every terminal modal in the Monitor (dashboard terminal, LXC terminal, script terminal) used to fail with *WebSocket connection error* on hosts where HTTPS was enabled. The root cause was specific to the `gevent + SSL` path: the gevent-websocket `WebSocketHandler` was stacked on top of flask-sock's protocol implementation, so the server emitted **two** consecutive `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols` headers and the browser closed the connection as a corrupt frame. Dropping the explicit `handler_class=WebSocketHandler` argument restores a single 101 response and the handshake completes normally. The fix is invisible to operators running on plain HTTP — they were unaffected — but unblocks every HTTPS-fronted install (reverse proxies, certificate-managed deployments, anything behind nginx/Traefik).

Additionally, the terminal panel used to lose its WebSocket connection when the user enabled the browser's auto-translate feature (Chrome / Edge / Safari "translate this page" prompts). The translator moves DOM nodes that React still holds refs to, and the WebSocket React component breaks because its container ref points to a moved node. Added `translate="no"` on the terminal container divs so the translator skips the embedded tty entirely — translations on the rest of the page still work.

---

## 🐧 Health Monitor — Kernel Update Detection on PVE 9.x (#208)

On Proxmox VE 9.x hosts, the *System Updates → Kernel / PVE* row used to report "Kernel/PVE up to date" even when an update for the running kernel was waiting upstream. Three combined causes, three combined fixes:

1. **Kernel-package prefix list** now includes `proxmox-kernel-*` and `proxmox-firmware-*` — PVE 9.x ships kernels under `proxmox-kernel-`, not the `pve-kernel-` prefix from 7.x / 8.x. The previous regex never matched the new packages and so never flagged any kernel update on 9.x.

2. **Dry-run switched from `apt-get upgrade --dry-run` to `apt-get dist-upgrade --dry-run`**. PVE 9 ships kernel updates packaged as new installs (not as straight upgrades of an existing package), and the plain `upgrade --dry-run` does not consider new installs at all. `dist-upgrade --dry-run` does.

3. **Running-kernel detection** now reads `uname -r` and flags an update as a *running-kernel update* when the package matches the running release exactly or its branch meta-package (e.g. `proxmox-kernel-6.14` for a host on `6.14.11-4-pve`). The row text distinguishes *"Running kernel update available (reboot required)"* from *"N kernel update(s) available (none for running kernel)"* so the operator knows whether they need to reboot or just install.

---

## 🟢 NVIDIA Installer

Several improvements driven by [@ghosthvj](https://github.com/ghosthvj)'s detailed field reports on mixed GPU configurations (see Acknowledgments):

- **Kernel compatibility window** — the version menu now respects the running kernel's compatible driver range, only offering branches that won't fail to compile against the host kernel.
- **Alpine LXC support** — the container-side userspace install was reworked so it succeeds on Alpine hosts; free-space detection works reliably across all storage layouts (LVM-thin, ZFS, directory, etc).
- **NVENC patch awareness** — when the host has the NVENC patch applied, the version menu narrows to drivers supported by the patch so reinstalling never silently loses it.
- **Uninstall feedback** — the uninstall path now reports a clear completion message instead of returning to the menu silently.

---

## 🌐 Documentation Site — Full i18n Migration

The companion documentation site (proxmenux.com) now ships under locale-prefixed URLs (`/en/...` and `/es/...`) with the next-intl plumbing. Every doc page is bilingual — 107 pages translated to Spanish (no copy-of-English placeholders). The root `/` redirects to `/en/` via meta-refresh + JS so the apex URL still resolves to something useful. RSS feeds work per-locale at `/en/rss.xml` and `/es/rss.xml`, with the canonical `/rss.xml` kept for backward compatibility with existing feed subscribers. Client-side search is wired up via **Pagefind** — the index is built fresh on every CI deploy from the final HTML output and downloaded fragmentally by the client, so search works without a server backend.

New documentation pages cover the **Active Suppressions** section in the Settings tab and the **per-event Dismiss dropdown** in the Health Monitor modal, both with screenshots reflecting the new UI.

---

## 🔧 Other Improvements

- **AI Enhancement section in Notifications** — rewritten from a muted uppercase row that testers consistently scrolled past, to a normal-case foreground label with a leading `Sparkles` icon and a persistent badge (green *Active* when AI is enabled, neutral *Optional* when it isn't) so the feature is discoverable regardless of state.
- **Disk temperature monitoring** — improved readings, smarter caching across SMART probes, and a redesigned history modal that opens at 24 h by default with min / avg / max statistics.
- **Post-install function update detection** — the Monitor tracks installed ProxMenux optimizations (Log2Ram, Memory Settings, System Limits, Logrotate, …) and notifies when a newer version is available, with one-click apply from Settings.
- **Secure Gateway (Tailscale) update flow** — one-click Tailscale update from Settings with Last-checked / Installed / Latest indicators and notification when a new version is published.
- **Helper-Scripts menu** — richer context and useful information for each entry, making it easier to know what every script does before running it.
- **Burst aggregation wording** — burst summaries now report only the *additional* events that arrived after the initial individual alert, so the operator no longer sees the first event counted twice.
- **Known-error classifier** — word-boundary regex on ATA / UNC patterns so kernel messages like `nvidia_uvm:FatalError` are no longer misclassified as ATA cable issues.
- **VM / CT control errors** — failed start / stop / restart now surfaces the real `pvesh` stderr (e.g. *"no space left on device"*) in the UI toast and fires a `vm_fail` / `ct_fail` notification, instead of the bare 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR the operator used to see.
- **log2ram apply path** — the auto / update flow now restarts log2ram after writing the new size, so a configured `512M` actually takes effect on the running tmpfs without a manual restart.
- **PVE webhook URL** — the notification webhook now follows the active SSL state automatically, switching between `http://` and `https://` when you toggle HTTPS in the panel.
- **Frontend 401 cascade** — the login screen no longer swallows a 401 forever after a brief stale-token state; the dedup flag is cleared on mount and on successful login.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This release includes direct code contributions from the community and a substantial amount of design-shaping feedback. Particular thanks to:

### Code contributors

**[@jcastro](https://github.com/jcastro)** landed five direct improvements that ship with v1.2.2:

- **Select VM ISOs from all ISO storages** — new shared helper `scripts/global/iso_storage_helpers.sh` plus integration in `vm_creator.sh`, `select_linux_iso.sh` and `select_windows_iso.sh`. The ISO picker now reads from every Proxmox storage tagged as ISO content instead of being pinned to `local`. Commit [`092b548d`](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/commit/092b548d).
- **Release channel switcher in Settings** — a proper menu under `scripts/menus/config_menu.sh` to flip between the stable and beta install channels in-place, with the right `version.txt` / `beta_version.txt` handling on each side. Commit [`f8a8c43d`](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/commit/f8a8c43d).
- **ZFS autotrim in the auto post-install** — `auto_post_install.sh` now enables `autotrim=on` on root ZFS pools by default (with the matching disable in the uninstall path), so SSD-backed installs reclaim freed space without manual intervention. Commit [`8877f987`](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/commit/8877f987).
- **Webhook loopback detection + update handoff** — `flask_notification_routes.py` correctly classifies `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` webhooks as loopback, and the `menu` script's update handoff no longer flakes on edge cases. Commit [`70ab072c`](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/commit/70ab072c).
- **Figurine bumped to 2.0.0** — banner tool refresh in `customizable_post_install.sh`, with the doc page updated to match. Commit [`aba94028`](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/commit/aba94028).

**[@pespinel](https://github.com/pespinel)** fixed a beta-installer regression that broke service paths after the move to the new runtime layout — `install_proxmenux_beta.sh` now resolves the right systemd unit paths on first install and on update. Commit [`0daab74a`](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/commit/0daab74a).

### Field reports that shaped the GPU + Coral work

**[@ghosthvj](https://github.com/ghosthvj)**'s detailed reports and suggestions on the hardware passthrough flow drove the GPU script improvements in this release. The NVIDIA installer fixes, the GPU + audio companion lifecycle hardening on `switch_gpu_mode.sh`, and the iGPU audio-companion checklist on `add_gpu_vm.sh::detect_optional_gpu_audio` all started from his reports of edge cases that the previous code paths handled poorly.

### Everyone else

A huge thank you to every user who opened an issue on GitHub, commented in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/discussions), reported a bug on the community channel, or stopped by to share what worked and what didn't on their hardware. **Many of the internal improvements in this release — the smartctl scheduler stagger, the fail2ban cache fix, the `lxc-info /proc` replacement, the HTTPS terminal handshake, the kernel-update detection on PVE 9.x, the entire Apprise wiring — started as a report from somebody running into the issue.** Keep them coming.

## 2026-04-20

### New version ProxMenux v1.2.1 — *SR-IOV Awareness & GPU Passthrough Hardening*

Targeted release on top of **v1.2.0** addressing three community-reported areas that needed fixing before the next stable cycle: full SR-IOV awareness across the GPU/PCI subsystem, robust handling of GPU + audio companions during passthrough attach and detach (Intel iGPU with chipset audio, discrete cards with HDMI audio, mixed-GPU VMs), and compatibility fixes for the AI notification providers (OpenAI-compatible custom endpoints such as LiteLLM/MLX/LM Studio, OpenAI reasoning models, and Gemini 2.5+/3.x thinking models). Also bundles quality-of-life fixes in the NVIDIA installer, the disk health monitor, and the LXC lifecycle helpers used by the passthrough wizards.

---

## 🎛️ SR-IOV Awareness Across the GPU Subsystem

Intel `i915-sriov-dkms` and AMD MxGPU split a GPU's Physical Function (PF) into Virtual Functions (VFs) that can be assigned independently to LXCs and VMs. Previously ProxMenux had zero SR-IOV awareness: it treated VFs and PFs identically, which could rewrite `vfio.conf` with the PF's vendor:device ID, collapse the VF tree on the next boot, and leave users unable to start their guests. Every path that could disrupt an active VF tree has been audited and hardened.

### Detection helpers
- New `_pci_is_vf`, `_pci_has_active_vfs`, `_pci_sriov_role`, `_pci_sriov_filter_array` in `scripts/global/pci_passthrough_helpers.sh`
- HTTP/JSON equivalents in the Flask GPU route — the Monitor UI reads VF/PF state directly from sysfs (`physfn`, `sriov_totalvfs`, `sriov_numvfs`, `virtfn*`)

### Pre-start hook (`gpu_hook_guard_helpers.sh`)
The VM pre-start guard now recognises Virtual Functions. Both the slot-only syntax branch (which used to iterate every function of the slot and demand `vfio-pci` everywhere) and the full-BDF branch skip VFs, so Proxmox can perform its per-VF vfio-pci rebind as usual. The false "GPU passthrough device is not ready" block on SR-IOV VMs is gone.

### Mode-switch scripts refuse SR-IOV operations
`switch_gpu_mode.sh`, `switch_gpu_mode_direct.sh`, `add_gpu_vm.sh`, `add_gpu_lxc.sh`, `vm_creator.sh`, `synology.sh`, `zimaos.sh` and `add_controller_nvme_vm.sh` all reject VFs and PFs with active VFs before touching host configuration. A clear "SR-IOV Configuration Detected" dialog explains the situation. For wizards invoked mid-flow (VM creators) the message is delivered through `whiptail` so it interrupts cleanly, followed by a per-device `msg_warn` line for the log trail.

### New "SR-IOV active" state in the Monitor UI
The GPU card in the Hardware page gains a third visual state with a dedicated teal colour, an in-line `SR-IOV ×N` pill (or `SR-IOV VF` for a Virtual Function), and dashed/faded LXC and VM branches. The Edit button is hidden because the state is hardware-managed.

![SR-IOV active card and modal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/main/images/sriov-indicator.png)

### Modal dashboard for SR-IOV GPUs
Opening the modal for a Physical Function with active VFs now shows:
- Aggregate-metrics banner ("Metrics below reflect the Physical Function, aggregate across N VFs")
- Normal GPU real-time telemetry for the PF
- A **Virtual Functions** table, one row per VF, with the current driver (`i915`, `vfio-pci`, unbound) and the specific VM or LXC that consumes it, including running/stopped state — consumers are discovered by cross-referencing `hostpci` entries and `/dev/dri/renderDN` mount lines against the VF's BDF and DRM render node

Opening the modal for a Virtual Function shows its parent PF (clickable to navigate back to the PF's modal), current driver, and consumer.

### VM Conflict Policy popup no longer fires for SR-IOV VFs
The regex in `detect_affected_vms_for_selected` matched the slot (`00:02`) against VMs that had a VF (`00:02.1`) assigned, producing a confusing "Keep GPU in VM config" dialog. With the SR-IOV gate upstream, the flow never reaches that code path for SR-IOV slots.

---

## 🔊 GPU + Audio Passthrough — Full Lifecycle Hardening

A round of fixes around how GPU passthrough handles its audio companion device. Previously, only the `.1` sibling of a discrete GPU was picked up automatically; Intel iGPU passthrough to a VM — where the audio lives separately on the chipset at `00:1f.3` and not at `00:02.1` — was silently skipped. On detach, the old `sed` that wiped hostpci lines by slot substring could also remove an unrelated GPU whose BDF happened to contain the search slot as a substring (e.g. slot `00:02` matching inside `0000:02:00.0`). Both paths are now robust.

### iGPU audio-companion checklist on attach
`add_gpu_vm.sh::detect_optional_gpu_audio` keeps the auto-include fast path for the classic `.1` sibling (discrete NVIDIA / AMD with HDMI audio on the card). When no `.1` audio exists, the script now:
- Scans sysfs for every PCI audio controller on the host
- Skips anything already covered by the GPU's IOMMU group
- Asks the user via a `_pmx_checklist` (`dialog` in standalone mode, `whiptail` in wizard mode called from `vm_creator`/`synology`/`zimaos`) which audio controllers to pass through alongside the GPU
- Displays each entry with its current host driver (`snd_hda_intel`, `snd_hda_codec_*`, etc.) so the decision is informed
- Defaults to **none** — the user actively opts in

### Orphan audio cascade on detach
When the user picks "Remove GPU from VM config" during a mode switch, the scripts now follow up with a targeted cleanup:
- `switch_gpu_mode.sh`, `switch_gpu_mode_direct.sh` and `add_gpu_vm.sh::cleanup_vm_config` (source-VM cleanup on the "move GPU" flow) all call the shared helper `_vm_list_orphan_audio_hostpci`
- The helper uses a two-pass scan of the VM config: pass 1 records slot bases of display/3D hostpci entries; pass 2 classifies audio entries and **skips any audio whose slot still has a display sibling in the same VM** — protecting the HDMI audio of other dGPUs left in the VM
- Previously the bare substring match would have flagged NVIDIA's `02:00.1` as orphan when detaching an Intel iGPU at `00:02.0`
- The interactive switch flow confirms removals with a `dialog` checklist (default ON). The web variant auto-removes without prompting — the runner has no good way to render a checklist — and logs every BDF it touched

### vfio.conf cascade extension
For each audio removed by the cascade, the switch-mode scripts now check whether its BDF is still referenced by any other VM via `_pci_bdf_in_any_vm`. If nothing else uses it, the `vendor:device` is appended to `SELECTED_IOMMU_IDS` before the `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf` update runs. That closes the loop for the Intel iGPU case: `8086:51c8` (PCH HD Audio) is now pulled from `vfio.conf` alongside `8086:46a3` (iGPU) when both leave VM mode and no other VM references them. If another VM still uses the audio, the ID is deliberately kept — no breaking side effects on other VMs. `add_gpu_vm.sh` does NOT extend the cleanup in the *move* flow, because the GPU is still in use elsewhere and its IDs must remain.

### Precise hostpci removal regex
Every inline `sed` used to detach a GPU from a VM config previously matched the slot as a free substring:
```
/^hostpci[0-9]+:.*${slot}/d
```
For `slot=00:02` that pattern matches the substring inside `0000:02:00.0` (an unrelated NVIDIA dGPU at slot `02:00`) and would wipe both cards. The fix anchors the match to the real BDF shape:
```
/^hostpci[0-9]+:[[:space:]]*(0000:)?${slot}\.[0-7]([,[:space:]]|$)/d
```
Applied in `switch_gpu_mode.sh`, `switch_gpu_mode_direct.sh` and `add_gpu_vm.sh::cleanup_vm_config`. The awk-based helper in `vm_storage_helpers.sh::_remove_pci_slot_from_vm_config` (used by the NVMe wizards) already used the correct pattern and did not need changes.

## 🤖 AI Provider Compatibility — OpenAI-Compatible, Reasoning & Thinking Models

Three coordinated fixes that unblock model categories previously rejected by the notification enhancement pipeline.

### OpenAI-compatible endpoints
LiteLLM, MLX, LM Studio, vLLM, LocalAI, Ollama-proxy — the provider's `list_models()` used to require `"gpt"` in every model name, so local setups serving `mlx-community/...`, `Qwen3-...`, `mistralai/...` saw an empty model list. When a Custom Base URL is set, the `"gpt"` substring check is now skipped and `EXCLUDED_PATTERNS` (embeddings, whisper, tts, dall-e) is the only filter. The Flask route layer also stops intersecting the result against `verified_ai_models.json` for custom endpoints — the verified list only describes OpenAI's official model IDs and was erasing every local model the user actually served.

### OpenAI reasoning models
`o1`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.2-pro`, `gpt-5.4-nano`, etc. (excluding the `*-chat-latest` variants) use a stricter API contract: `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`, no `temperature`. Sending the classic chat parameters produced HTTP 400 Bad Request for every one of them. A detector in `openai_provider.py` now branches the payload accordingly and sets `reasoning_effort: "minimal"` — by default these models spend their output budget on internal reasoning and return an empty reply for the short notification-translation request.

### Gemini 2.5+ / 3.x thinking models
`gemini-2.5-flash`, `2.5-pro`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, etc. have internal "thinking" enabled by default. With the small token budget used for notification enrichment (≤250 tokens), the thinking budget consumed the entire allowance and the model returned empty output with `finishReason: MAX_TOKENS`. `gemini_provider.py` now sets `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget: 0` for non-`lite` variants of 2.5+ and 3.x, so the available tokens go to the user-visible response. Lite variants (no thinking enabled) are untouched.

---

## 📋 Verified AI Models Refresh

`AppImage/config/verified_ai_models.json` refreshed for the providers re-tested against live APIs. The new private maintenance tool (kept out of the AppImage) re-runs a standardised translate+explain test against every model each provider advertises, classifies pass / warn / fail, and prints a ready-to-paste JSON snippet. Re-run before each ProxMenux release to keep the list current.

| Provider | New recommended | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **OpenAI** | `gpt-4.1-nano` | `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-chat-latest`, plus `gpt-5.4-nano` / `gpt-5.4-mini` from 2026-03. Dated snapshots and legacy models excluded. Reasoning models supported by code but not listed by default — slower / costlier without improving notification quality |
| **Gemini** | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-2.5-flash` (works now), `gemini-3-flash-preview`. `latest` aliases intentionally omitted — resolved to different models across runs and produced timeouts in some regions. Pro variants reject `thinkingBudget=0` and are overkill for notification translation |
| Groq / Anthropic / OpenRouter | *unchanged* | Marked with a `_note` — will be re-verified as soon as keys are available |

## 🩺 Disk Health Monitor — Observation Persistence in the Journal Watcher

A latent bug in `notification_events.py::_check_disk_io` meant real-time kernel I/O errors caught by the journal watcher were surfaced as notifications but never written to the permanent per-disk observations table. In practice the parallel periodic dmesg scan usually recorded the observation shortly after, but under timing edge cases (stale dmesg window, service restart right after the error, buffer rotation) the observation could go missing.

The journal watcher now records the observation before the 24h notification cooldown gate, using the same family-based signature classification (`io_<disk>_ata_connection_error`, `io_<disk>_block_io_error`, `io_<disk>_ata_failed_command`) as the periodic scan. Both paths now deduplicate into the same row via the UPSERT in `record_disk_observation`, so occurrence counts are accurate regardless of which detector fired first.

---

## 🔧 NVIDIA Installer Polish

### `lsmod` race condition silenced
During reinstall, the module-unload verification in `unload_nvidia_modules` produced spurious `lsmod: ERROR: could not open '/sys/module/nvidia_uvm/holders'` errors because `lsmod` reads `/proc/modules` and then opens each module's `holders/` directory, which disappears transiently while the module is being removed. The check now reads `/proc/modules` directly and inserts short sleeps to let the kernel finalise the unload before re-verifying. Applied in the same spirit to the four other `lsmod` call sites in the script.

### Dialog → whiptail in the LXC update flow
The "Insufficient Disk Space" message in `update_lxc_nvidia` and the "Update NVIDIA in LXC Containers" confirmation now use `whiptail`-style dialogs consistent with the rest of the in-flow messaging, avoiding the visual break that `dialog --msgbox` caused when rendered mid-sequence in the container-update phase.

---

## 🧵 LXC Lifecycle Helper — Timeout-Safe Stop

A plain `pct stop` can hang indefinitely when the container has a stale lock from a previous aborted operation, when processes inside (Plex, Jellyfin, databases) ignore TERM and fall into uninterruptible-sleep while the GPU they were using is yanked out, or when `pct shutdown --timeout` is not enforced by pct itself. Field reports of 5+ min waits during GPU mode switches made this a real UX hazard.

New shared helper `_pmx_stop_lxc <ctid> [log_file]` in `pci_passthrough_helpers.sh`:
1. Returns 0 immediately if the container is not running
2. Best-effort `pct unlock` (silent on failure) — most containers aren't actually locked; we only care about the cases where they are
3. `pct shutdown --forceStop 1 --timeout 30` wrapped in an external `timeout 45` so we never wait longer than that for the graceful phase, even if pct stalls on backend I/O
4. Verifies actual status via `pct status` — pct can return non-zero while the container is in fact stopped
5. If still running, `pct stop` wrapped in `timeout 60`. Verify again
6. Returns 1 only if the container is truly stuck after ~107 s total — the wizard moves on instead of hanging

Wired into the three GPU-mode paths that stop LXCs during a switch: `switch_gpu_mode.sh`, `switch_gpu_mode_direct.sh`, and `add_gpu_vm.sh::cleanup_lxc_configs`.

---

## ⚙️ `add_gpu_vm.sh` Reboot Prompt Stability

The final "Reboot Required" prompt of the GPU-to-VM assignment wizard was triggering spurious reboots in certain menu-chain invocations (`menu` → `main_menu` → `hw_grafics_menu` → `add_gpu_vm`). With the `_pmx_yesno` helper it sometimes returned exit 0 without the user having actually confirmed, calling `reboot` immediately. With a bare `read` in its place the process would get SIGTTIN-suspended when the menu chain detached the script from the terminal's foreground process group, leaving `[N]+ Stopped menu` on the parent shell with no chance to answer.

The prompt now uses `whiptail --yesno` invoked directly (the pattern verified to work reliably in that menu chain) and inserts a `Press Enter to continue ... read -r` pause between the "Yes" answer and the actual `reboot` call — so an accidental Enter on the confirm button cannot trigger an immediate reboot without a visible confirmation step first.

### 🙏 Thanks

Thank you to the users who reported the SR-IOV, LiteLLM/MLX and GPU + audio cases — these improvements exist because of detailed, reproducible reports. Feel free to keep reporting issues or suggesting improvements 🙌.

### New version ProxMenux v1.2.0 — *AI-Enhanced Monitoring*


![ProxMenux AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/main/images/ProxMenux_ai.png)

This release is the culmination of the v1.1.9.1 → v1.1.9.6 beta cycle and introduces the biggest evolution of **ProxMenux Monitor** to date: AI-enhanced notifications, a redesigned multi-channel notification system, a fully reworked hardware and storage experience, and broad performance improvements across the monitoring stack. It also consolidates all recent work on the Storage, Hardware and GPU/TPU scripts.

---

## 🤖 ProxMenux Monitor — AI-Enhanced Notifications

Notifications can now be enhanced using AI to generate clear, contextual messages instead of raw technical output.

Example — instead of `backup completed exitcode=0 size=2.3GB`, AI produces: *"The web server backup completed successfully. Size: 2.3GB"*.

### What AI does
- Transforms technical notifications into readable messages
- Translates to your preferred language
- Lets you choose detail level: minimal, standard, or detailed
- Works with Telegram, Discord, Email, Pushover, and Webhooks

### What AI does NOT do
- It is **not** a chatbot or assistant
- It does **not** analyze your system or make decisions
- It does **not** have access to data beyond the notification being processed
- It does **not** execute commands or modify the server
- It does **not** store history or learn from your data

### Multi-Provider Support
Choose between 6 AI providers, each with its own API key stored independently:
- **Groq** — fast inference, generous free tier
- **Google Gemini** — excellent quality/price ratio, free tier available
- **OpenAI** — industry standard
- **Anthropic Claude** — excellent for writing and translation
- **OpenRouter** — 300+ models with a single API key
- **Ollama** — 100% local execution, no internet required

### Verified AI Models
A curated list of models (`verified_ai_models.json`) tested specifically for notification enhancement.

- **Hybrid verification**: the system fetches provider-side models and filters to only show those tested to work correctly
- **Per-Provider Model Memory**: selected model is saved per provider, so switching providers preserves each choice
- **Daily verification**: background task checks model availability and auto-migrates to a verified alternative if the current model disappears
- **Incompatible models excluded**: Whisper, TTS, image/video, embeddings, guard models, etc. are filtered out per provider

| Provider | Recommended | Also Verified |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Gemini | gemini-2.5-flash-lite | gemini-flash-lite-latest |
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | gpt-4.1-mini |
| Groq | llama-3.3-70b-versatile | llama-3.1-70b-versatile, llama-3.1-8b-instant, llama3-70b-8192, llama3-8b-8192, mixtral-8x7b-32768, gemma2-9b-it |
| Anthropic | claude-3-5-haiku-latest | claude-3-5-sonnet-latest, claude-3-opus-latest |
| OpenRouter | meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct | meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct, anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku, google/gemini-flash-2.5-flash-lite, openai/gpt-4o-mini, mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct |
| Ollama | (all local models) | No filtering — shows all installed models |

### Custom AI Prompts
Advanced users can define their own prompt for full control over formatting and translation.

- **Prompt Mode selector** — Default Prompt or Custom Prompt
- **Export / Import** — save and share custom prompts across installations
- **Example Template** — starting point to build your own prompt
- **Community Prompts** — direct link to GitHub Discussions to share templates
- Language selector is hidden in Custom Prompt mode (you define the output language in the prompt itself)

### Enriched Context
- System **uptime** is included only for error/warning events (not informational ones) — helps distinguish startup vs runtime errors
- **Event frequency** tracking — indicates recurring vs one-time issues
- **SMART disk health** data is passed for disk-related errors
- **Known Proxmox errors** database improves diagnosis accuracy
- Clearer prompt instructions to prevent AI hallucinations

---

## 📨 Notification System Redesign

- **Multi-Channel Architecture** — Telegram, Discord, Pushover, Email, and Webhook channels running simultaneously
- **Per-Event Configuration** — enable/disable specific event types per channel
- **Channel Overrides** — customize notification behaviour per channel
- **Secure Webhook Endpoint** — external systems can send authenticated notifications
- **Encrypted Storage** — API keys and sensitive data stored encrypted
- **Queue-Based Processing** — background worker with automatic retry for failed notifications
- **SQLite-Based Config Storage** — replaces file-based config for reliability

### Telegram Topics Support
Send notifications to a specific topic inside groups with Topics enabled.
- New **Topic ID** field on the Telegram channel
- Automatic detection of topic-enabled groups
- Fully backwards compatible

### ProxMenux Update Notifications
The Monitor now detects when a new ProxMenux version is released.
- **Dual-channel** — monitors both stable (`version.txt`) and beta (`beta_version.txt`)
- **GitHub integration** — compares local vs remote versions
- **Dashboard Update Indicator** — the ProxMenux logo changes to an update variant when a new version is detected (non-intrusive, no popups)
- **Persistent state** — status stored in `config.json`, reset by update scripts
- Single toggle in Settings controls both channels (enabled by default)

---

## 🖥️ Hardware Panel — Expanded Detection

The Hardware page has been significantly expanded, with better detection and richer per-device detail.

- **SCSI / SAS / RAID Controllers** — model, driver and PCI slot shown in the storage controllers section
- **PCIe Link Speed Detection** — NVMe drives show current link speed (PCIe generation and lane width), making it easy to spot drives underperforming due to limited slot bandwidth
- **Enhanced Disk Detail Modal** — NVMe, SATA, SAS, and USB drives now expose their specific fields (PCIe link info, SAS version/speed, interface type) instead of a generic view
- **Smarter Disk Type Recognition** — uniform labelling for NVMe SSDs, SATA SSDs, HDDs and removable disks
- **Hardware Info Caching** (`lspci`, `lspci -vmm`) — 5 min cache avoids repeated scans for data that doesn't change

---

## 💽 Storage Overview — Health, Observations, Exclusions

The Storage Overview has been reworked around real-time state and user-controlled tracking.

### Disk Health Status Alignment
- Badges now reflect the **current** SMART state reported by Proxmox, not a historical worst value
- **Observations preserved** — historical findings remain accessible via the "X obs." badge
- **Automatic recovery** — when SMART reports healthy again, the disk immediately shows **Healthy**
- Removed the old `worst_health` tracking that required manual clearing

### Disk Registry Improvements
- **Smart serial lookup** — when a serial is unknown the system checks for an existing entry with a serial before inserting a new one
- **No more duplicates** — prevents separate entries for the same disk appearing with/without a serial
- **USB disk support** — handles USB drives that may appear under different device names between reboots

### Storage and Network Interface Exclusions
- **Storage Exclusions** section — exclude drives from health monitoring and notifications
- **Network Interface Exclusions** — new section for excluding interfaces (bridges `vmbr`, bonds, physical NICs, VLANs) from health and notifications; ideal for intentionally disabled interfaces that would otherwise generate false alerts
- **Separate toggles** per item for Health monitoring and Notifications

### Disk Detection Robustness
- **Power-On-Hours validation** — detects and corrects absurdly large values (billions of hours) on drives with non-standard SMART encoding
- **Intelligent bit masking** — extracts the correct value from drives that pack extra info into high bytes
- **Graceful fallback** — shows "N/A" instead of impossible numbers when data cannot be parsed

---

## 🧠 Health Monitor & Error Lifecycle

### Stale Error Cleanup
Errors for resources that no longer exist are now resolved automatically.
- **Deleted VMs / CTs** — related errors auto-resolve when the resource is removed
- **Removed Disks** — errors for disconnected USB or hot-swap drives are cleaned up
- **Cluster Changes** — cluster errors clear when a node leaves the cluster
- **Log Patterns** — log-based errors auto-resolve after 48 hours without recurrence
- **Security Updates** — update notifications auto-resolve after 7 days

### Database Migration System
- **Automatic column detection** — missing columns are added on startup
- **Schema compatibility** — works with both old and new column naming conventions
- **Backwards compatible** — databases from older ProxMenux versions are supported
- **Graceful migration** — no data loss during schema updates

---

## 🧩 VM / CT Detail Modal

The VM/CT detail modal has been completely redesigned for usability.

- **Tabbed Navigation** — *Overview* (general information, status, resource usage) and *Backups* (dedicated history)
- **Visual Enhancements** — icons throughout, improved hierarchy and spacing, better VM vs CT distinction
- **Mobile Responsiveness** — adapts correctly to mobile screens in both webapp and direct browser access, no more overflow on small devices
- **Touch-Friendly Controls** — larger buttons and spacing

### Secure Gateway Modal
- **Scrollable storage list** when many destinations are available
- Mobile-adapted layout and improved visual hierarchy

### Terminal Connection
- **Reconnection loop fix** that was affecting mobile devices
- Improved WebSocket handling for mobile browsers
- More graceful connection timeout recovery

### Fail2ban & Lynis Management
- **Delete buttons** added in Settings for both tools
- Clean removal of packages and configuration files
- Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

Major reduction in CPU usage and elimination of spikes on the Monitor.

### Staggered Polling Intervals
Collectors now run on offset schedules to prevent simultaneous execution:

| Collector | Schedule |
|-----------|----------|
| CPU sampling | Every 30s at offset 0 |
| Temperature sampling | Every 15s at offset 7s |
| Latency pings | Every 60s at offset 25s |
| Temperature record | Every 60s at offset 40s |
| Health collector | Starts at 55s offset |
| Notification polling | Health=10s, Updates=30s, ProxMenux=45s, AI=50s |

### Cached System Information
Expensive commands now cached to reduce repeated execution:

| Command | Cache TTL | Impact |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `pveversion` | 6 hours | Eliminates 23%+ CPU spikes from Perl execution |
| `apt list --upgradable` | 6 hours | Reduces package manager queries |
| `pvesh get /cluster/resources` | 30 seconds | 6 API calls per request reduced to 1 |
| `sensors` | 10 seconds | Temperature readings cached between polls |
| `smartctl` (SMART health) | 30 minutes | Disk health checks reduced from every 5 min |
| `lspci` / `lspci -vmm` | 5 minutes | Hardware info cached (doesn't change) |
| `journalctl --since 24h` | 1 hour | Login attempts count cached (92% reduction) |

### Increased journalctl Timeouts
Prevents timeout cascades under system load:

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Short-term (3-10 min) | 3s | 10s |
| Medium-term (1 hour) | 5s | 15s |
| Long-term (24 hours) | 5s | 20s |

### Reduced Polling Frequency
- `TaskWatcher` interval raised from **2s → 5s** (60% fewer checks)

### GitHub Actions
- All workflow actions upgraded to **v6** for Node.js 24 compatibility
- Deprecation warnings eliminated in CI/CD

---

## 🧰 Scripts — Storage, Hardware and GPU/TPU Work

This release also consolidates significant work on the core ProxMenux scripts.

### Storage scripts
- **SMART scheduled tests** and improved interactive SMART test workflow with clearer progress feedback
- **Disk formatting** (`format-disk.sh`) rework with safer device selection and dialog flow
- **Disk passthrough** for VMs and CTs — updated device enumeration, serial-based identification, and cleaner teardown
- **NVMe controller addition for VMs** — improved controller type selection and slot detection
- **Import disk image** — smoother path validation and progress reporting
- **Disk & storage manual guide** refresh

### Hardware / GPU / TPU scripts
- **Coral TPU installer** updated for current kernels and udev rules (Proxmox VE 8 & VE 9)
- **NVIDIA installer** — cleaner driver installation, kernel header handling, and VM/LXC attachment flow
- **GPU mode switch** (direct and interactive variants) — safer switching between iGPU modes
- **Add GPU to VM / LXC** — unified selection dialogs and permission handling
- **Intel / AMD GPU tools** kept in sync with the new shared patterns
- **Hardware & graphics menu** restructured for consistency with the rest of ProxMenux


## 2026-03-14

### New version v1.1.9 — *Helper Scripts Catalog Rebuilt*

### Changed

- **Helper Scripts Menu — Full Catalog Rebuild**
  The Helper Scripts catalog has been completely rebuilt to adapt to the new data architecture of the [Community Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/) project.

  The previous implementation relied on a `metadata.json` file that no longer exists in the upstream repository. The catalog now connects directly to the **PocketBase API** (`db.community-scripts.org`), which is the new official data source for the project.

  A new GitHub Actions workflow generates a local `helpers_cache.json` index that replaces the old metadata dependency. This new cache is richer, more structured, and includes:
  - Script type, slug, description, notes, and default credentials
  - OS variants per script (e.g. Debian, Alpine) — each shown as a separate selectable option in the menu
  - Direct GitHub URL and **Mirror URL** (`git.community-scripts.org`) for every script
  - Category names embedded directly in the cache — no external requests needed to build the menu
  - Additional metadata: default port, website, logo, update support, ARM availability

  Scripts that support multiple OS variants (e.g. Docker with Alpine and Debian) now correctly show **one entry per OS**, each with its own GitHub and Mirror download option — restoring the behavior that existed before the upstream migration.

---

### 🎖 Special Acknowledgment

This update would not have been possible without the openness and collaboration of the **Community Scripts** maintainers.

When the upstream metadata structure changed and broke the ProxMenux catalog, the maintainers responded quickly, explained the new architecture in detail, and provided all the information needed to rebuild the integration cleanly.

Special thanks to:

- **MickLeskCanbiZ ([@MickLesk](https://github.com/MickLesk))** — for documenting the new script path structure by type and slug, and for the clear and direct technical guidance.
- **Michel Roegl-Brunner ([@michelroegl-brunner](https://github.com/michelroegl-brunner))** — for explaining the new PocketBase collections structure (`script_scripts`, `script_categories`).

The Helper Scripts project is an extraordinary resource for the Proxmox community. The scripts belong entirely to their authors and maintainers — ProxMenux simply offers a guided way to discover and launch them. All credit goes to the community behind [community-scripts/ProxmoxVE](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE).

### New version v1.1.8 — *ProxMenux Offline Mode*

![ProxMenux Offline](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/ProxMenux_offline.png)

---

### Added

- **Offline Execution Mode (no GitHub dependency)**  
  All ProxMenux core scripts now run **entirely locally**, without requiring live requests to GitHub (`raw.githubusercontent.com`).  
  This change provides:
  - Greater stability during execution
  - No interruptions due to network timeouts or regional GitHub blocks
  - Support for **offline or isolated environments**

  ⚠️ This update resolves recent issues where users in certain regions were unable to run scripts due to CDN or TLS filtering errors while downloading `.sh` files from GitHub raw URLs.

  **🎖 Special Acknowledgment: @cod378**  
  This offline conversion has been made possible thanks to the extraordinary work of **@cod378**,  
  who redesigned the entire internal logic of the installer and updater, refactored the file management system,  
  and implemented the new fully local execution workflow.  
  Without his collaboration, dedication, and technical contribution, this transformation would not have been possible.

- **ProxMenux Monitor v1.0.1**  
  This update brings a major leap in the **ProxMenux Monitor** interface.  
  New features and improvements:
  - `Proxy Support`: Access ProxMenux through reverse proxies with full functionality
  - `Authentication System`: Secure your dashboard with password protection
  - `Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)`: Optional TOTP support for enhanced security
  - `PCIe Link Speed Detection`: View NVMe connection speeds and detect performance bottlenecks
  - `Enhanced Storage Display`: Auto-formats disk sizes (GB → TB when appropriate)
  - `SATA/SAS Interface Info`: Detect and show storage type (SATA, SAS, NVMe, etc.)
  - `Health Monitoring System`: Built-in system health check with dismissible alerts
  - Improved rendering across browsers and better performance

- **Helper Scripts Menu (Mirror Support)**  
  The `Helper Scripts` menu now:
  - Detects **mirror URLs** and shows alternative download options when available
  - Lists available OS versions when a helper script is version-dependent (e.g. template installers)

---

### Fixed

- Minor fixes and refinements throughout the codebase to ensure full offline compatibility and a smoother user experience.



## 2025-09-04

  Your new monitoring tool for Proxmox. Discover all the features that will help you manage and supervise your infrastructure efficiently.

  ProxMenux Monitor is designed to support future updates where **actions can be triggered without using the terminal**, and managed through a **user-friendly interface** accessible across multiple formats and devices.

  Access it at: **http://your-server-ip:8008**

  ![ProxMenux Monitor](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/monitor/welcome.png)
- **New Banner Removal Method**  
  A new function to disable the Proxmox subscription message with improved safety:
  - Creates a full backup before modifying any files
  - Shows a clear warning that breaking changes may occur with future GUI updates
  - If the GUI fails to load, the user can revert changes via SSH from the post-install menu using the **"Uninstall Options → Restore Banner"** tool

  Special thanks to **@eryonki** for providing the improved method.

---

### Improved

- **CORAL TPU Installer Updated for PVE 9**  
  The CORAL TPU driver installer now supports both **Proxmox VE 8 and VE 9**, ensuring compatibility with the latest kernels and udev rules.

- **Log2RAM Installation & Integration**  
  - Log2RAM installation is now idempotent and can be safely run multiple times.
  - Automatically adjusts `journald` configuration to align with the size and behavior of Log2RAM.
  - Ensures journaling is correctly tuned to avoid overflows or RAM exhaustion on low-memory systems.

- **Network Optimization Function (LXC + NFS)**  
  Improved to prevent “martian source” warnings in setups where **LXC containers share storage with VMs** over NFS within the same server.

- **APT Upgrade Progress**  
  When running full system upgrades via ProxMenux, a **real-time progress bar** is now displayed, giving the user clear visibility into the update process.

---

### Fixed

- Other small improvements and fixes to optimize runtime performance and eliminate minor bugs.



## 2025-01-10

### New version v1.1.6

![Shared Resources Menu](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/share/main-menu.png)


### Added

- **New Menu: Mount and Share Manager**  
  Introduced a comprehensive new menu for managing shared resources between Proxmox host and LXC containers:

  **Host Configuration Options:**
  - **Configure NFS Shared on Host** - Add, view, and remove NFS shared resources on the Proxmox server with automatic export management
  - **Configure Samba Shared on Host** - Add, view, and remove Samba/CIFS shared resources on the Proxmox server with share configuration  
  - **Configure Local Shared on Host** - Create and manage local shared directories with proper permissions on the Proxmox host

  **LXC Integration Options:**
  - **Configure LXC Mount Points (Host ↔ Container)** - **Core feature** that enables mounting host directories into LXC containers with automatic permission handling. Includes the ability to **view existing mount points** for each container in a clear, organized way and **remove mount points** with proper verification that the process completed successfully. Especially optimized for **unprivileged containers** where UID/GID mapping is critical.
  - **Configure NFS Client in LXC** - Set up NFS client inside privileged containers
  - **Configure Samba Client in LXC** - Set up Samba client inside privileged containers  
  - **Configure NFS Server in LXC** - Install NFS server inside privileged containers
  - **Configure Samba Server in LXC** - Install Samba server inside privileged containers

  **Documentation & Support:**
  - **Help & Info (commands)** - Comprehensive guides with step-by-step manual instructions for all sharing scenarios

  The entire system is built around the **LXC Mount Points** functionality, which automatically detects filesystem types, handles permission mapping between host and container users, and provides seamless integration for both privileged and unprivileged containers.

---

### Improved

- **Log2RAM Auto-Detection Enhancement**  
  In the automatic post-install script, the Log2RAM installation function now prompts the user when automatic disk ssd/m2 detection fails.
  This ensures Log2RAM can still be installed on systems where automatic disk detection doesn't work properly.

---

### Fixed

- **Proxmox Update Repository Verification**  
  Fixed an issue in the Proxmox update function where empty repository source files would cause errors during conflict verification. The function now properly handles empty `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` files without throwing false warnings.

  Thanks to **@JF_Car** for reporting this issue.

---

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **@JF_Car**, **@ghosthvj**, and **@jonatanc** for their testing, valuable feedback, and suggestions that helped refine the shared resources functionality and improve the overall user experience.



## 2025-08-20

### New version v1.1.5

### Added

- **New Script: Upgrade PVE 8 to PVE 9**  
  Added a full upgrade tool located under `Utilities and Tools`. It provides:
  1. **Automatic upgrade** from PVE 8 to 9
  2. **Interactive upgrade** with step-by-step confirmations
  3. **Check-only mode** using `check-pve8to9`
  4. **Manual instructions** shown in order for users who prefer to upgrade manually

- **New Tools in System Utilities**
  - [`s-tui`](https://github.com/amanusk/s-tui): Terminal-based CPU monitoring with graphs
  - [`intel-gpu-tools`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools): Useful for Intel GPU diagnostics

---

### Improved

- **APT Upgrade Handling**  
  The PVE upgrade function now blocks the process if any package prompts for manual confirmation. This avoids partial upgrades and ensures consistency.

- **Network Optimization (sysctl)**  
  - Obsolete kernel parameters removed (e.g., `tcp_tw_recycle`, `nf_conntrack_helper`) to prevent warnings in **Proxmox 9 / kernel 6.14**
  - Now generates only valid, up-to-date sysctl parameters

- **AMD CPU Patch Handling**  
  - Now applies correct `idle=nomwait` and KVM options (`ignore_msrs=1`, `report_ignored_msrs=0`)
  - Expected warning is now documented and safely handled for stability with Ryzen/EPYC

- **Timezone & NTP Fixes**  
  - Automatically detects timezone using public IP geolocation
  - Falls back to UTC if detection fails
  - Restarts Postfix after timezone set → resolves `/var/spool/postfix/etc/localtime` mismatch warning

- **Repository & Package Installer Logic**  
  - Now verifies that working repositories exist before installing any package
  - If none are available, adds a fallback **Debian stable** repository
  - Replaces deprecated `mlocate` with `plocate` (compatible with Debian 13 and Proxmox 9)

- **Improved Logs and User Feedback**  
  - Actions that fail now provide precise messages (instead of falsely marking as success)
  - Helps users clearly understand what's been applied or skipped



## 2025-08-06

### New version v1.1.4

### Added

- **Proxmox 9 Compatibility Preparation**  
  This version prepares **ProxMenux** for the upcoming **Proxmox VE 9**:
  - The function to add the official Proxmox repositories now supports the new `.sources` format used in Proxmox 9, while maintaining backward compatibility with Proxmox 8.
  - Banner removal is now optionally supported for Proxmox 9.

- **xshok-proxmox Detection**  
  Added a check to detect if the `xshok-proxmox` post-install script has already been executed.  
  If detected, a warning is shown to avoid conflicting adjustments:

  ```
  It appears that you have already executed the xshok-proxmox post-install script on this system.

  If you continue, some adjustments may be duplicated or conflict with those already made by xshok.

  Do you want to continue anyway?
  ```

---

### Improved

- **Banner Removal (Proxmox 8.4.9+)**  
  Updated the logic for removing the subscription banner in **Proxmox 8.4.9**, due to changes in `proxmoxlib.js`.

- **LXC Disk Passthrough (Persistent UUID)**  
  The function to add a physical disk to an LXC container now uses **UUID-based persistent paths**.  
  This ensures that disks remain correctly mounted, even if the `/dev/sdX` order changes due to new hardware.

  ```bash
  PERSISTENT_DISK=$(get_persistent_path "$DISK")
  if [[ "$PERSISTENT_DISK" != "$DISK" ]] ...
  ```

- **System Utilities Installer**  
  Now checks whether APT sources are available before installing selected tools.  
  If a new Proxmox installation has no active repos, it will **automatically add the default sources** to avoid installation failure.

- **IOMMU Activation on ZFS Systems**  
  The function that enables IOMMU for passthrough now verifies existing kernel parameters to avoid duplication if the user has already configured them manually.

---

### Fixed

- Minor code cleanup and improved runtime performance across several modules.

### Changed

- **Subscription Banner Removal (Proxmox 8.4.5+)**  
  Improved the `remove_subscription_banner` function to ensure compatibility with Proxmox 8.4.5, where the banner removal method was failing after clean installations.

- **Improved Log2RAM Detection**  
  In both the automatic and customizable post-install scripts, the logic for Log2RAM installation has been improved.  
  Now it correctly detects if Log2RAM is already configured and avoids triggering errors or reconfiguration.

- **Optimized Figurine Installation**  
  The `install_figurine` function now avoids duplicating `.bashrc` entries if the customization for the root prompt already exists.


### Added

- **New Function: Persistent Network Interface Naming**  
  Added a new function `setup_persistent_network` to create stable network interface names using `.link` files based on MAC addresses.  
  This avoids unpredictable renaming (e.g., `enp2s0` becoming `enp3s0`) when hardware changes, PCI topology shifts, or passthrough configurations are applied.

  **Why use `.link` files?**  
  Because predictable interface names in `systemd` can change with hardware reordering or replacement. Using static `.link` files bound to MAC addresses ensures consistency, especially on systems with multiple NICs or passthrough setups.

  Special thanks to [@Andres_Eduardo_Rojas_Moya] for contributing the persistent  
  network naming function and for the original idea.

```bash
[Match]
MACAddress=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

[Link]
Name=eth0
```

### New version v1.1.3

![Installer Menu](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/install/install.png)

- **Dual Installation Modes for ProxMenux**  
  The installer now offers two distinct modes:  
  1. **Lite version (no translations):** Only installs two official Debian packages (`dialog`, `jq`) to enable menus and JSON parsing. No files are written beyond the configuration directory.  
  2. **Full version (with translations):** Uses a virtual environment and allows selecting the interface language during installation.  

  When updating, if the user switches from full to lite, the old version will be **automatically removed** for a clean transition.

### Added

- **New Script: Automated Post-Installation Setup**  
  A new minimal post-install script that performs essential setup automatically:  
  - System upgrade and sync  
  - Remove enterprise banner  
  - Optimize APT, journald, logrotate, system limits  
  - Improve kernel panic handling, memory settings, entropy, network  
  - Add `.bashrc` tweaks and **Log2RAM auto-install** (if SSD/M.2 is detected)

- **New Function: Log2RAM Configuration**  
  Now available in both the customizable and automatic post-install scripts.  
  On systems with SSD/NVMe, Log2RAM is **enabled automatically** to preserve disk life.

- **New Menus:**
  - 🧰 **System Utilities Menu**  
    Lets users select and install useful CLI tools with proper command validation.
  - 🌐 **Network Configuration & Repair**  
    A new interactive menu for analyzing and repairing network interfaces.

### Improved

- **Post-Install Menu Logic**  
  Options are now grouped more logically for better usability.

- **VM Creation Menu**  
  Enhanced with improved CPU model support and custom options.

- **UUP Dump ISO Creator Script**  
  - Added option to **customize the temporary folder location**  
  - Fixed issue where entire temp folder was deleted instead of just contents

### Other

- Performance and code cleanup improvements across several modules.



## 2025-06-06

### Added

- **New Menu: Proxmox PVE Helper Scripts**  
  Officially introduced the new **Proxmox PVE Helper Scripts** menu, replacing the previous: Esenciales Proxmox.  
  This new menu includes:
  - Script search by name in real time
  - Category-based browsing

  It’s a cleaner, faster, and more functional way to access community scripts in Proxmox.

  ![Helper Scripts Menu](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/menu-helpers-script.png)


- **New CPU Models in VM Creation**  
  The CPU selection menu in VM creation has been greatly expanded to support advanced QEMU and x86-64 CPU profiles.  
  This allows better compatibility with modern guest systems and fine-tuning performance for specific workloads, including nested virtualization and hardware-assisted features.


  ![CPU Config](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/vm/config-cpu.png)

  Thanks to **@Nida Légé (Nidouille)** for suggesting this enhancement.


- **Support for `.raw` Disk Images**  
  The disk import tool for VMs now supports `.raw` files, in addition to `.img`, `.qcow2`, and `.vmdk`.  
  This improves compatibility when working with disk exports from other hypervisors or backup tools.

  💡 Suggested by **@guilloking** in [GitHub Issue #5](https://github.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/issues/5)


- **Locale Detection in Language Skipping**  
  The function that disables extra APT languages now includes:
  - Automatic locale detection (`LANG`)
  - Auto-generation of `en_US.UTF-8` if none is found
  - Prevents warnings during script execution due to undefined locale


### Improved

- **APT Language Skipping Logic**  
  Improved locale handling ensures system compatibility before disabling translations:
  ```bash
  if ! locale -a | grep -qi "^${default_locale//-/_}$"; then
      echo "$default_locale UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen
      locale-gen "$default_locale"
  fi
  ```

- **System Update Speed**  
  Post-install system upgrades are now faster:  
  - The upgrade process (`dist-upgrade`) is separated from container template index updates.
  - Index refresh is now an optional feature selected in the script.



## 2025-05-27

### Fixed
- **Kali Linux ISO URL Updated**  
  Fixed the incorrect download URL for Kali Linux ISO in the Linux installer module. The new correct path is:  
  ```
  https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2025.1c/kali-linux-2025.1c-installer-amd64.iso
  ```

### Improved
- **Faster Dialog Menu Transitions**  
  Improved UI responsiveness across all interactive menus by replacing `whiptail` with `dialog`, offering faster transitions and smoother navigation.

- **Coral USB Support in LXC**  
  Improved the logic for configuring Coral USB TPU passthrough into LXC containers:
  - Refactored configuration into modular blocks with better structure and inline comments.
  - Clear separation of Coral USB (`/dev/coral`) and Coral M.2 (`/dev/apex_0`) logic.
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing LXC configurations.
  - Introduced persistent Coral USB passthrough using a udev rule:
    ```bash
    # Create udev rule for Coral USB
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="18d1", ATTRS{idProduct}=="9302", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess", SYMLINK+="coral"
    
    # Map /dev/coral if it exists
    if [ -e /dev/coral ]; then
        echo "lxc.mount.entry: /dev/coral dev/coral none bind,optional,create=file" >> "$CONFIG_FILE"
    fi
    ```
  - Special thanks to **@Blaspt** for validating the persistent Coral USB passthrough and suggesting the use of `/dev/coral` symbolic link.


### Added
- **Persistent Coral USB Passthrough Support**  
  Added udev rule support for Coral USB devices to persistently map them as `/dev/coral`, enabling consistent passthrough across reboots. This path is automatically detected and mapped in the container configuration.

- **RSS Feed Integration**  
  Added support for generating an RSS feed for the changelog, allowing users to stay informed of updates through news clients.

- **Release Service Automation**  
  Implemented a new release management service to automate publishing and tagging of versions, starting with version **v1.1.2**.


## 2025-05-13

### Fixed

- **Startup Fix on Newer Proxmox Versions**\
  Fixed an issue where some recent Proxmox installations lacked the `/usr/local/bin` directory, causing errors when installing the execution menu. The script now creates the directory if it does not exist before downloading the main menu.\
  Thanks to **@danielmateos** for detecting and reporting this issue.

### Improved

- **Updated Lynis Installation Logic in Post-Install Settings**\
  The `install_lynis()` function was improved to always install the **latest version** of Lynis by cloning the official GitHub repository:
  ```
  https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis.git
  ```
  The installation process now ensures the latest version is always fetched and linked properly within the system path.

  Thanks to **@Kamunhas** for reporting this enhancement opportunity.

- **Balanced Memory Optimization for Low-Memory Systems**  
  Improved the default memory settings to better support systems with limited RAM. The previous configuration could prevent low-spec servers from booting. Now, a more balanced set of kernel parameters is used, and memory compaction is enabled if supported by the system.

  ```bash
  cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory.conf
  # Balanced Memory Optimization
  vm.swappiness = 10
  vm.dirty_ratio = 15
  vm.dirty_background_ratio = 5
  vm.overcommit_memory = 1
  vm.max_map_count = 65530
  EOF

  # Enable memory compaction if supported by the system
  if [ -f /proc/sys/vm/compaction_proactiveness ]; then
    echo "vm.compaction_proactiveness = 20" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory.conf
  fi

  # Apply settings
  sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-memory.conf
  ```

  These values help maintain responsiveness and system stability even under constrained memory conditions.

  Thanks to **@chesspeto** for pointing out this issue and helping refine the optimization.


## 2025-05-04

### Added
- **Interactive Help & Info Menu**  
  Added a new script called `Help and Info`, which provides an interactive command reference menu for Proxmox VE through a dialog-based interface.  
  This tool offers users a quick way to browse and copy useful commands for managing and maintaining their Proxmox server, all in one centralized location.

  ![Help and Info Menu](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/help/help-info-menu.png)

  *Figure 1: Help and Info interactive command reference menu.*

- **Uninstaller for Post-Install Utilities**  
  A new script has been added to the **Post-Installation** menu, allowing users to uninstall utilities or packages that were previously installed through the post-install script.

### Improved
- **Utility Selection Menu in Post-Installation Script**  
  The `Install Common System Utilities` section now includes a menu where users can choose which utilities to install, instead of installing all by default. This gives more control over what gets added to the system.

- **Old PV Header Detection and Auto-Fix**  
  After updating the system, the post-update script now includes a security check for physical disks with outdated LVM PV (Physical Volume) headers.  
  This issue can occur when virtual machines have passthrough access to disks and unintentionally modify volume metadata. The script now detects and automatically updates these headers.  
  If any error occurs during the process, a warning is shown to the user.

- **Faster Translations in Menus**  
  Several post-installation menus with auto-translations have been optimized to reduce loading times and improve user experience.


## 2025-04-14

### Added
- **New Script: Disk Passthrough to a CT**
Introduced a new script that enables assigning a dedicated physical disk to a container (CT) in Proxmox VE.
This utility lists available physical disks (excluding system and mounted disks), allows the user to select a container and one disk, and then formats or reuses the disk before mounting it inside the CT at a specified path.
It supports detection of existing filesystems and ensures permissions are properly configured. Ideal for use cases such as Samba, Nextcloud, or video surveillance containers.

### Improved  
- Visual Identification of Disks for Passthrough to VMs
Enhanced the disk detection logic in the Disk Passthrough to a VM script by including visual indicators and metadata.
Disks now display tags like ⚠ In use, ⚠ RAID, ⚠ LVM, or ⚠ ZFS, making it easier to recognize their current status at a glance. This helps prevent selection mistakes and improves clarity for the user.

## 2025-03-24  
### Improved  
- Improved the logic for detecting physical disks in the **Disk Passthrough to a VM** script. Previously, the script would display disks that were already mounted in the system on some setups. This update ensures that only unmounted disks are shown in Proxmox, preventing confusion and potential conflicts.  

- This improvement ensures that disks already mounted or assigned to other VMs are excluded from the list of available disks, providing a more accurate and reliable selection process.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-03-21
### Improved
- Improved the logic of the post-install script to prevent overwriting or adding duplicate settings if similar settings are already configured by the user.
- Added a warning note to the documentation explaining that using different post-installation scripts is not recommended to avoid conflicts and duplicated settings.

### Added
- **Create Synology DSM VM**:  
  A new script that creates a VM to install Synology DSM. The script automates the process of downloading three different loaders with the option to use a custom loader provided by the user from the local storage options.  
  Additionally, it allows the use of both virtual and physical disks, which are automatically assigned by the script.  

  ![VM description](https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/vm/synology/dsm_desc.png)
  
  *Figure 1: Synology DSM VM setup overview.*

- **New VM Creation Menu**:  
  A new menu has been created to enable VM creation from templates or custom scripts.
